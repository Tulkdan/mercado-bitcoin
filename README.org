* Payment Gateway


** Getting started

*** Prerequisites

- [[https://hurl.dev][hurl]] :: CLI tool that runs http requests, similar to curl
- [[https://just.systems/][just]] ::  CLI runner
- [[https://jqlang.org/][jq]] :: (Optional) CLI tool to query JSON data

If you're using nix, you can find a flake in the root of the project and run =nix develop= to download all the tools (or allow [[https://direnv.net/][direnv]] to auto import in your path)

*** Usage

In a terminal, build and run the project with =just=, it will start the project in port =8000=

#+begin_src shell
just run
#+end_src

**** Create Order

In other terminal, make the request with hurl

#+begin_src shell
hurl request-sell.hurl
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell
hurl request-buy.hurl
#+end_src

In case you want to see the response with json format, you can use jq

#+begin_src shell
hurl request-sell.hurl | jq .
#+end_src


**** Cancel an Order

#+begin_src shell
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:8000/order/{ORDER-ID}'
#+end_src

**** Consult account balance

#+begin_src shell
curl 'http://localhost:8000/account/{ACCOUNT-ID}'
#+end_src

*** Implementation

The project was made using an ideia of event-sourcing, so that every order made is added into a queue (implemented in this project with an in-memory array) of operations
with this we can easily rebuild the balance of the account,
have a history of operations and do the auditing of the system as a whole.
